Test your buffer cache’s effectiveness by measuring its cache hit rate. First, reset the buffer cache.
Open a file and read it sequentially, to determine the cache hit rate for a cold cache. Then, close
it, re-open it, and read it sequentially again, to make sure that the cache hit rate improves.
Test your buffer cache’s ability to coalesce writes to the same sector. Each block device keeps
a read_cnt counter and a write_cnt counter. Write a large file byte-by-byte (make the total
file size at least 64KB, which is twice the maximum allowed buffer cache size). Then, read it in
byte-by-byte. The total number of device writes should be on the order of 128 (because 64KB is
128 blocks).
